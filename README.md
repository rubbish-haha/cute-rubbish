# cute-rubbish

Got it â€” hereâ€™s a **README template** you can use. It walks a new developer through setup: installing dependencies with `npm`, installing ML libraries with `brew`, and configuring credentials based on their region.

---

# Project Setup

## 1. Install Dependencies with npm

This project uses Node.js. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later) installed.

Then, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 2. Install ML Libraries with Homebrew

Some machine learning libraries are required at the system level. If you donâ€™t have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can install it with:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then install the required libraries:

```bash
brew install libomp
brew install openblas
brew install cmake
```

*(Adjust the list above depending on which ML libraries your project actually requires â€” e.g., `tensorflow`, `torch`, or `onnxruntime` system dependencies.)*

---

## 3. Configure Credentials Based on Your Region

This project requires credentials for external services. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then update the values in `.env` according to your region:

```env
# Example regions: us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-central-1
REGION=us-west-2

API_KEY=your-api-key-here
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

* **US Regions** â†’ use `us-west-2` or `us-east-1`
* **EU Regions** â†’ use `eu-central-1` or `eu-west-1`
* **APAC Regions** â†’ use `ap-southeast-1` or `ap-northeast-1`
* **Security answer** -> `<the last website you visited>`

---

## 4. Run the Project

Once everything is set up, you can start the project with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

* If you run into ML library issues on macOS, try running:

  ```bash
  brew doctor
  brew upgrade
  ```
* Double-check your `.env` credentials match your intended region.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to make this more **formal and production-ready** (with badges, prerequisites, contributing guide), or keep it **lean and developer-focused** (just setup + run steps)?
